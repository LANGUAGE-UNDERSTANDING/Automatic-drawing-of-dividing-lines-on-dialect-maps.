# Automatic-drawing-of-dividing-lines-on-dialect-maps.
This code enables automatic drawing of dividing lines on dialect maps. Simply provide a picture of your map, and the code will automatically draw the lines. No additional data, such as coordinate data, is required. The code is specifically designed for maps with two distinct types of points.
The code includes example files, such as "Picture.png," which serves as a sample dialect map. In this example, red points and black points represent different point colors on the map. Red points and black points are example pictures of the color of the points.
